# Project - Dragon Ball
- This project is created using this following **API**: *https://web.dragonball-api.com/*. 
- The page updates automatically when new characters and planets are added to the API.

## Proposal

- The neighborhood comic store has come across this website *(https://web.dragonball-api.com/)* and they want you to set up an web of the same style using **CSS, HTML and Javascript**.

- You have to use the **End-points** made available by the website, investigate and try how to get what you need and as requested.

## Requirements

- Making relevant **commits** and push them to the repository.
- The page must have a **HEADER**, a **MAIN** and a **FOOTER**.
- Organizing the folders in our code **(Clean coding)**
- Explain the project and how to install it on the **README**
- **2 pages** (all the characters/ planets on a single page for each one).

## Install instructions

1) Enter the **URL address** of the **API**.

  
2) Go to **docs** section and copy the following endpoints.
   
- You can access the list of characters by using the **/characters** endpoint.

3) Download **Postman** and paste both endpoints.


4) Copy and paste these lines in the first line of your **.js code.** You need to appoint the **amount** of **characters/planets** you want in **each page**
   
 (**Example:** *limit=58* means *58 characters per page*)
